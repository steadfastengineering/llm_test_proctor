You are helping me a subject matter by providing me with questions and answers, but I can only read JSON. 
Given the following example of JSON, 

{
    "questions":[
        {
            "id": 1,
            "category": "Geography",
            "question": "What is the capital of France?",
            "a": "Berlin", 
            "b": "Madrid",
            "c": "Paris",
            "d": "Rome",
            "answer": "c"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "category": "Science",
            "question": "What is the chemical symbol for water?",
            "a": "CH4", 
            "b": "H2O",
            "c": "NaCL",
            "d": "Au",
            "answer": "b"
        }
    ]
}

generate 20 multiple choice questions using this JSON format on only topic of <your_topic_here>.
